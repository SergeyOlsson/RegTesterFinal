Regtester is a program I made in Java as a part of my Degree Project that lasted 1 month. This is a program intended for testing purposes only. 
What does it do? It's a program that is used to find errors on a registration form. 
How does it work? When starting the program, you get to choose between 3 browsers. 
Once you selected a browser, you will get redirected to a specific website we used for testing. 
When you get to the website you may test to click a "missing button", "bad button" or a "success button". 
Clicking on missing button will autofill each field correctly but the specific missing field, it will leave it blank. 
Clicking on bad button will autofill each field correctly but the specific bad field, this field will have an incorrect value.
Clicking on success button will autofill each field correctly and save values from registration, if succeeded. 
I am currently working on RegTester 2.0 which is more sophisticated and is not bound to a specific webpage.
